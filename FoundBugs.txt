14.If the table is empty  and when you add the data , data is inserting in ASC order on firstname value
but if the data is already there in the table - existing data is not properly sorted

15.Enter the fields with FN,LN values greater than 50 characters
Actual - on UI , it shows no validation msg
Expected it should show - it should allow maximum of 50 characters


16.After deleting the employee - it would be nice to show the user Emplye "XXX" has been deleted successfully

17.I see the application allows employees with same data
18.there is no easy way to search for a specific employee based on FN or LN..etc
19.IT would be nice to have to implement sortig on FN, LN columns
20.IF there are many employees, pagination is recommended for performance of the application

21.After logout when you click the back arrow on the tab
Actual - Im able to see the benefits dashboard page,, i.e logged into the application without proper login mechanism
Expected: We shouldn't let users to login without antering credentials

22.NetPay calculations are not showing properly
For ex: actual = 1923.08
Expected = 1923.07

23.The application is working with predefined values like gross pay, it would be nice if it would let us enter the employee salary also along with employee details
